A Data-Driven Approach to Financial Market Prediction and Investment Strategy Optimization

# 🏢 Business Context

A globally recognized investment firm known for its strategic interest in emerging markets delivers flexible and technology-driven investment solutions tailored to diverse client profiles. However, after missing key investment opportunities in the previous quarter due to delayed and inefficient decision-making, Prime INC is looking to integrate machine learning to drive predictive insights and optimize stock portfolio strategies.

# 🎯 Business Problem
Prime INC seeks to overcome limitations in traditional investment analysis by embracing data-driven methods. The key challenge is:

**How can we accurately predict the direction of stock prices to identify profitable investment opportunities and reduce risk?**

##❗ Specific Obstacles
 * **Missed Opportunities:** Delayed analysis led to lost high-return opportunities.

 * **Lack of Predictive Models:** No reliable mechanism to forecast stock price direction.

 * **Complex Financial Interpretation:** Difficulty extracting insight from financial statements.

 * **Unquantified Risks:** Limited understanding of volatility and exposure in prospective assets.

# 📌 Project Objectives

* Analyze high-potential stocks from Prime INC's portfolio.

* Benchmark these stocks against major indices such as S&P 500 and FTSE 100.

* Compare performance between NVDA (NVIDIA) and QUBT (Quantum Computing Inc.) — two firms under consideration for future investment.

* Measure:

  * 📊 Volatility & Risk

  * 🔄 Correlation with Market Indices

  * 💰 Market Capitalization

  * 📈 Stock Price Trend & Direction
